For ten days, the streets fill with jugglers, knights, craftsmen, and the aroma of roasting meats. It's the biggest historical event in the Algarve, drawing over 300,000 visitors.</p>\n\n<p>But here's the thing - most tourists experience it wrong.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-to-go-the-real-advice\">When to Go (The Real Advice)</h2>\n\n<strong>Official dates:</strong> August 9-18, 2026\n\n<p>The fair runs from 6pm to 1am daily. Most tourists arrive around 8pm and leave before midnight. Here's what the locals do instead:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"best-days\">Best Days</h3>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Tuesday or Wednesday</strong> - Significantly fewer crowds</li><li><strong>First weekend</strong> - Slightly less crowded than the closing weekend</li><li><strong>Avoid</strong> the final Saturday - peak attendance, long queues everywhere</li></ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"best-hours\">Best Hours</h3>\n\n<ul><li><strong>6pm-7pm</strong> - Arrive early, explore while it's quiet, secure a good dinner spot</li><li><strong>11pm-1am</strong> - The magic hour. Crowds thin out, performers give their best shows</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-to-park-without-losing-your-mind\">Where to Park (Without Losing Your Mind)</h2>\n\n<p>Parking is the #1 complaint about Silves Fair. Follow these tips:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use the free park-and-ride</strong> from the Silves football stadium. Shuttles run every 15 minutes.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Arrive before 6:30pm</strong> if you want street parking near the center.</li></ul>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Never park on the road to Monchique</strong> - you'll be stuck in traffic for 2 hours trying to leave.</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-to-eat\">What to Eat</h2>\n\n<p>Skip the first stalls you see at the entrance. Walk deeper into the fair for better food at lower prices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"must-try-foods\">Must-Try Foods</h3>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Espetadas</strong> - Beef skewers grilled over open flame</li><li><strong>Pão com chouriço</strong> - Bread stuffed with chouriço, baked in wood-fired oven</li><li><strong>Caracóis</strong> - Snails in garlic broth (more delicious than it sounds)</li><li><strong>Farturas</strong> - Portuguese churros, fresh and hot</li></ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"pro-tip\">Pro Tip</h3>\n\n<p>Bring cash. Many stalls don't accept cards, and the ATMs have long queues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-shows-you-can-t-miss\">The Shows You Can't Miss</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-joust\">The Joust</h3>\n\n<p>Held at the arena near the castle. Performances at 9pm and 11pm. The 11pm show is better - smaller crowd, cooler temperature, more energetic performers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fire-performers\">Fire Performers</h3>\n\n<p>Roam between the castle and the main square after 10:30pm. Some of the best fire dancing you'll see anywhere in Portugal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-parade\">The Parade</h3>\n\n<p>Opens each evening at 6pm, starting at the castle gates. Worth watching on your first night to set the mood.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-kids\">Taking Kids?</h2>\n\n<p>The fair is very family-friendly until about 10pm, when it shifts to a more adult atmosphere (more drinking, louder music).</p>\n\n<strong>Best for kids:</strong>\n<ul><li>Archery lessons near the castle</li><li>Puppet shows in the children's area</li><li>Face painting and crafts</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-secret-visit-silves-castle-by-day\">The Secret: Visit Silves Castle by Day</h2>\n\n<p>Most people only see the castle at night during the fair. Come back during the day (before the fair opens) to explore the impressive Moorish fortifications properly. Entry is cheap and the views over the orange groves are spectacular.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"quick-facts\">Quick Facts</h2>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free entry to the streets, some shows require tickets</li><li><strong>Dress code:</strong> Medieval costumes encouraged but not required</li><li><strong>Language:</strong> Most vendors speak English</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Plan for 4-5 hours minimum</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Want the exact dates and our restaurant recommendations for this year?</strong> Subscribe to our newsletter for the complete Silves Fair guide when summer approaches.\n",
