## The 12 Best Hiking Trails in Algarve

### 1. Seven Hanging Valleys Trail (Percurso dos Sete Vales Suspensos)

## Essential Hiking Tips for the Algarve

### Best Time to Hike

- **October to May** — Ideal hiking weather (15-22°C)
- **March-April** — Wildflowers in bloom, green landscapes
- **Summer (June-September)** — Only early morning or evening. Midday is dangerously hot on exposed coastal trails

### What to Bring

- **Water** — At least 1.5 liters per person, more in warm weather
- **Sun protection** — Hat, sunscreen, sunglasses (essential year-round)
- **Layers** — Coastal wind can be chilly even on warm days
- **Good footwear** — Trail shoes minimum; boots for mountain routes
- **Snacks** — Most trails have no facilities
- **Phone with GPS** — Download offline maps as backup

### Safety Considerations

- **Stay on marked trails** — Cliff edges are unstable and dangerous
- **Check weather** — Wind can be severe on exposed coastal sections
- **Tell someone your plans** — Especially for longer routes
- **Start early in summer** — Be off exposed trails by 11am
- **Bring more water than you think you need**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the most scenic hike in Algarve?

The Seven Hanging Valleys Trail is widely considered the most scenic, with constant coastal views, dramatic cliffs, and the famous Benagil Cave viewpoint. However, the Ponta da Piedade walk near Lagos rivals it for dramatic rock formations.

### Can I hike in Algarve in summer?

Yes, but with caution. Start very early (before 8am) and choose shaded routes like Fonte da Benémola or the Monchique mountain trails. Avoid exposed coastal walks in the middle of the day — temperatures can exceed 35°C with no shade.

### Are the trails well-marked?

Generally excellent. The major trails (Seven Hanging Valleys, Rota Vicentina, Via Algarviana) have professional signposting. Smaller local trails vary but are usually adequate.

### Do I need hiking boots?

Trail shoes with good grip are sufficient for most coastal walks. Proper hiking boots are recommended for mountain routes like Monchique or Rocha da Pena, and for the rockier sections of the Fishermen's Trail.

### Can I walk with children?

Many trails are suitable for families. The Benagil to Marinha walk, Ria Formosa trails, and Alte village walk are all flat and easy. Avoid cliff-edge walks with young children.
