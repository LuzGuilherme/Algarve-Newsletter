They're missing out on something special - the Serra de Monchique, a mountain range covered in cork oak forests, eucalyptus groves, and natural springs.</p>\n\n<p>At 902 meters, Foia is the highest point in the Algarve. On clear days, you can see both the Atlantic coast and the mountains of Spain.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-foia-summit-trail\">1.

A paved path leads from the summit car park through heathland with panoramic views. Perfect for families or a quick mountain fix.</p>\n\n<strong>What you'll see:</strong> Radio towers, sweeping coastal views, wild herbs (rosemary, lavender, thyme)\n\n<strong>Best time:</strong> Early morning for clearest views, or sunset for golden light\n\n<h2 id=\"2-picota-circular-route\">2.
