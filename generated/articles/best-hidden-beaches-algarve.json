After living here for years, we've discovered the secret spots that even many locals don't know about.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-praia-da-mesquita\">1. Praia da Mesquita</h2>\n\n<p>Tucked between the cliffs near Carvoeiro, this tiny cove is accessible only during low tide. The golden sand is framed by dramatic rock formations that glow orange at sunset.</p>\n\n<strong>How to get there:</strong> Park at the Algar Seco parking lot and walk east along the cliff path for about 15 minutes. Look for a narrow trail descending between the rocks.\n\n<strong>Best time to visit:</strong> Early morning, 2 hours before or after low tide.\n\n<h2 id=\"2-praia-do-barranco\">2. Praia do Barranco</h2>\n\n<p>This remote beach near Sagres requires a 20-minute hike, which keeps the crowds away. Crystal-clear waters and dramatic cliff backdrops make it worth every step.</p>\n\n<strong>Pro tip:</strong> Bring water and snacks - there are no facilities here. That's part of the charm.\n\n<h2 id=\"3-praia-da-ingrina\">3. Praia da Ingrina</h2>\n\n<p>A small fishing village beach that time forgot. The local fishermen still pull their boats up on the sand, and there's a simple restaurant serving fresh catch of the day.</p>\n\n<strong>What makes it special:</strong> Authentic Algarve atmosphere without the tourist infrastructure.\n\n<h2 id=\"4-praia-do-zavial\">4. Praia do Zavial</h2>\n\n<p>Beloved by surfers for its consistent waves, this beach offers a completely different vibe from the typical Algarve experience. Great for watching sunsets with a beer from the beach bar.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-praia-da-figueira\">5. Praia da Figueira</h2>\n\n<p>Hidden in the Costa Vicentina Natural Park, this beach is a 30-minute drive from Lagos but feels like another world. Protected dunes, wild vegetation, and powerful Atlantic waves.</p>\n\n<strong>Warning:</strong> Strong currents - swimming not recommended, but perfect for walking and photography.\n\n<h2 id=\"6-praia-do-barril\">6. Praia do Barril</h2>\n\n<p>Access this beach by riding the tiny tourist train through the Ria Formosa wetlands. Famous for its \"anchor cemetery\" - hundreds of rusted anchors left behind by tuna fishermen.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-praia-da-manta-rota\">7. Praia da Manta Rota</h2>\n\n<p>On the eastern Algarve, this endless stretch of sand remains relatively quiet even in August. Warm, calm waters perfect for families with young children.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"planning-your-beach-day\">Planning Your Beach Day</h2>\n\n<p>The best time to explore these beaches is early morning (before 10am) or late afternoon (after 5pm). You'll avoid the heat and have the best light for photos.</p>\n\n<p>Always check tide times before visiting cliff-accessible beaches. Some become completely submerged at high tide.</p>\n\n<strong>Ready for more insider tips?</strong> Join our newsletter and discover a new hidden gem every week.\n",
