But there's a secret that wine lovers are just beginning to discover: the Algarve produces some of Portugal's most exciting wines, and the wine tasting experiences here are intimate, authentic, and far from the tourist crowds.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"article-image\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506377247377-2a5b3b417ebb?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=1200\" alt=\"Vineyard rows in golden afternoon light with rolling hills in the background, Algarve Portugal\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Vineyard rows in golden afternoon light with rolling hills in the background, Algarve Portugal</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>We've spent years exploring Algarve wine tasting experiences — from family-run estates where three generations still tend the vines, to award-winning quintas producing wines that rival anything from the north. This guide shares everything we've learned about discovering the Algarve's hidden wine culture.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you're staying in Lagos, Albufeira, or anywhere along the coast, a wine tasting experience offers something different: a glimpse into the soul of the region, beyond the beaches and cliffs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-the-algarve-is-portugal-s-rising-wine-region\">Why the Algarve is Portugal's Rising Wine Region</h2>\n\n<p>The Algarve might be famous for its coastline, but its wine-growing credentials date back over 2,000 years. The Romans planted vineyards here, and the tradition never stopped — it just stayed quiet while the Douro and Alentejo claimed the spotlight.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"article-image\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560493676-04071c5f467b?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=1200\" alt=\"Sun-drenched vineyard with Mediterranean vegetation and blue sky, southern Portugal\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Sun-drenched vineyard with Mediterranean vegetation and blue sky, southern Portugal</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>What makes the Algarve special for wine? Geography plays a crucial role:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Over 3,000 hours of sunshine annually</strong> — more than almost any wine region in Europe. The grapes ripen fully, developing intense flavours and natural sweetness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Serra de Monchique mountains</strong> act as a natural barrier, protecting the vineyards from cold northern winds while allowing cooling Atlantic breezes to moderate the summer heat. This creates a microclimate that's perfect for winemaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diverse terroir</strong> — from limestone slopes near the coast to schist-rich soils in the interior. Different grape varieties thrive in different pockets, giving Algarve wines remarkable diversity for such a small region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Low yields, high quality</strong> — most Algarve wineries are small, family operations focused on quality over quantity. You won't find industrial-scale production here. Instead, you'll taste wines made with care, often from vines that are decades old.</p>\n\n<p>The region has earned four DOC (Denominação de Origem Controlada) designations — Portugal's highest quality classification. This isn't a region trying to become a wine destination; it's a region finally being recognized for what it's always been.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-algarve-wine-the-four-doc-regions\">Understanding Algarve Wine: The Four DOC Regions</h2>\n\n<p>The Algarve's wine production is organized into four distinct DOC regions, each with its own character. Understanding these helps you plan which wineries to visit based on where you're staying.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lagos-doc-western-algarve-wines\">Lagos DOC — Western Algarve Wines</h3>\n\n<p>The westernmost wine region, covering Lagos, Aljezur, and Vila do Bispo. Wines here are influenced by the Atlantic, with cooling ocean breezes moderating the heat. Expect robust reds with good acidity and full-bodied whites that pair brilliantly with the region's seafood.</p>\n\n<p>If you're staying in Lagos or the western Algarve, this is your local wine region. Several excellent wineries are within a 20-minute drive.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"portim-o-doc-full-bodied-character\">Portimão DOC — Full-Bodied Character</h3>\n\n<p>Centred around Portimão and extending inland, this region produces some of the Algarve's most structured wines. The red wines tend to be full-bodied with good aging potential, while the whites show tropical fruit notes balanced by fresh acidity.</p>\n\n<p>The famous Quinta dos Vales is located here, making it an essential stop for any wine tour in the central Algarve.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"lagoa-doc-the-heart-of-algarve-wine\">Lagoa DOC — The Heart of Algarve Wine</h3>\n\n<p>This is where you'll find the highest concentration of wineries and the most established wine tourism infrastructure. The Lagoa region extends through Albufeira, Lagoa, Loulé, and <a href=\"/blog/best-day-trips-from-lagos-portugal\">Silves</a> — the historic capital of the Algarve.</p>\n\n<p>The rolling hills around Silves are particularly beautiful, and several quintas here have been producing wine for centuries. If you only have time for one wine area, this is it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tavira-doc-eastern-mediterranean-influence\">Tavira DOC — Eastern Mediterranean Influence</h3>\n\n<p>The eastern Algarve's wine region benefits from a slightly different climate — warmer and drier, with more Mediterranean than Atlantic influence. Wines here tend toward elegance and aromatics, with lighter reds and crisp whites.</p>\n\n<p>This region is less developed for wine tourism but offers a more off-the-beaten-path experience for adventurous wine lovers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-algarve-s-signature-grapes\">The Algarve's Signature Grapes</h2>\n\n<p>Understanding a few key grape varieties will deepen your appreciation during wine tastings. Here's what to look for:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"negra-mole-the-indigenous-star\">Negra Mole: The Indigenous Star</h3>\n\n<p>If there's one grape that defines Algarve wine, it's Negra Mole. This indigenous variety is the second-oldest grape in Portugal — it was already here when the Moors arrived. At its peak, Negra Mole accounted for 75% of all Algarve vineyards.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"article-image\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510812431401-41d2bd2722f3?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=1200\" alt=\"Close-up of wine being poured into a glass during a tasting, with vineyard in background\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Close-up of wine being poured into a glass during a tasting, with vineyard in background</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>What makes Negra Mole special is its versatility. Depending on how it's vinified, it can produce:</p>\n<ul><li>Light, refreshing white wines</li><li>Elegant rosés</li><li>Medium-bodied reds with soft tannins</li><li>Even sparkling wines</li></ul>\n\n<p>The grape nearly disappeared in the 20th century as winemakers chased international varieties, but a new generation of producers is bringing Negra Mole back. Ask for it at tastings — it's uniquely Algarvian and you won't find it anywhere else in the world.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"other-key-red-varieties\">Other Key Red Varieties</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Castelão</strong> (also called Periquita) — Portugal's most planted red grape thrives in the Algarve's heat, producing wines with red fruit flavours and spicy notes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trincadeira</strong> — Another Portuguese native, known for floral aromas and firm structure. It adds complexity to blends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Touriga Nacional</strong> — Portugal's most prestigious grape has adapted well to the Algarve, producing concentrated wines with deep colour and bold tannins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon</strong> — Recent arrivals that have found a happy home in the Algarve sun, often blended with local varieties.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"key-white-varieties\">Key White Varieties</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Arinto</strong> — High acidity makes this grape perfect for balancing the Algarve's ripe fruit flavours. Wines are fresh and age-worthy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Malvasia Fina</strong> — Aromatic and textured, producing wines with stone fruit and floral notes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Síria</strong> (locally called Crato Branco) — Makes rich, full-bodied whites that stand up to the region's grilled fish.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"10-best-wineries-for-wine-tasting-in-the-algarve\">10 Best Wineries for Wine Tasting in the Algarve</h2>\n\n<p>After years of visiting Algarve wineries, these are our top recommendations for memorable wine tasting experiences.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"western-algarve-wineries\">Western Algarve Wineries</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"quinta-dos-vales-est-mbar\">Quinta dos Vales (Estômbar)</h3>\n\n<p>This is the Algarve's most impressive wine estate and our top recommendation for first-time visitors. Spread across 44 hectares, Quinta dos Vales combines serious winemaking with an extraordinary sculpture garden featuring over 50 works of art.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes it special:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The \"Winemaker for a Day\" experience lets you blend your own wine from their varieties. Their flagship \"Marquês dos Vales Grace\" wines have won international awards. The estate also hosts concerts and events throughout summer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tasting options:</strong></p>\n\n<p>From simple tastings (€15-25) to full winemaking experiences (€150+). The property is stunning and worth visiting for the art alone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Between Portimão and Lagoa, easily accessible from anywhere in the central Algarve.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monte-da-casteleja-lagos\">Monte da Casteleja (Lagos)</h3>\n\n<p>A smaller, family-run operation near Lagos producing organic wines. The setting is peaceful, the wines are excellent, and the welcome is warm. This is wine tasting as it should be — personal and unpretentious.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Visitors staying in Lagos who want a local experience without the tourist crowds.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"central-algarve-wineries-lagoa-silves-area\">Central Algarve Wineries (Lagoa/Silves Area)</h3>\n\n<p>This is the heartland of Algarve wine, and you could easily spend a full day exploring these estates.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quinta-do-franc-s-silves\">Quinta do Francês (Silves)</h3>\n\n<p>Set in the beautiful Odelouca River Valley near Silves, this French-owned quinta produces elegant wines that reflect both Portuguese tradition and French winemaking expertise. The Touriga Nacional and Syrah blend is particularly impressive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes it special:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Intimate tastings in a peaceful valley setting. The owners are often present and passionate about sharing their story.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend the <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/silves-l91370/algarve-classic-wine-tour-tasting-in-silves-t421329/?partner_id=YTNRNDJ&utm_medium=online_publisher&cmp=blog\">Algarve Classic Wine Tour in Silves</a>, which includes visits to estates in this area with transportation and a knowledgeable guide.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"morgado-do-quint-o-silves\">Morgado do Quintão (Silves)</h3>\n\n<p>One of the Algarve's historic estates, Morgado do Quintão has been producing wine for centuries. The quinta is beautifully maintained, and the wines — especially their aged reds — show what the Algarve can achieve when tradition meets modern winemaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visitor rating:</strong> 4.7 stars — consistently praised for welcoming hosts and excellent wines.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quinta-da-tor-loul\">Quinta da Tor (Loulé)</h3>\n\n<p>A 47-hectare estate producing some of the Algarve's most interesting wines, including rare high-alcohol varieties (up to 17%) that showcase just how ripe the grapes can get in this climate. Seven different grape varieties are cultivated, each expressing the unique terroir.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes it special:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The diversity of wines available and the knowledgeable guides who explain the connection between land and wine.</p>\n\n<p>Book the <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/algarve-l66/loule-quinta-da-tor-winery-tour-with-wine-tastings-t387504/?partner_id=YTNRNDJ&utm_medium=online_publisher&cmp=blog\">Quinta da Tor Winery Tour with Wine Tastings</a> for a guided experience at this excellent estate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"convento-do-para-so-silves\">Convento do Paraíso (Silves)</h3>\n\n<p>Wine has been made on this site since the 15th century, when it was a convent. Today, 25 hectares of vineyards surround the historic buildings. There's something magical about tasting wine in a place with 500 years of winemaking history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n\n<p>History lovers and anyone who wants to connect with the deep roots of Algarve wine culture.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"adega-do-cantor-guia\">Adega do Cantor (Guia)</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, this is Sir Cliff Richard's winery, but don't let the celebrity connection fool you — the wines are serious. The coastal location near Albufeira means sea breezes moderate the heat, and the views from the tasting terrace are spectacular.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What makes it special:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The \"Vida Nova\" wines are well-crafted, and the setting overlooking the coast adds something special to the experience.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"herdade-barranco-do-vale-s-o-bartolomeu-de-messines\">Herdade Barranco do Vale (São Bartolomeu de Messines)</h3>\n\n<p>The Algarve's northernmost winery, tucked into the hills toward <a href=\"/blog/best-day-trips-from-lagos-portugal\">Monchique</a>. The cooler elevation produces wines with more freshness and elegance. Their tractor tours through the vineyards are a fun, authentic experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Families and anyone wanting something different from the typical tasting room experience.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"eastern-algarve-wineries\">Eastern Algarve Wineries</h3>\n\n<h3 id=\"al-lagar-by-casa-santos-lima-tavira\">Al-Lagar by Casa Santos Lima (Tavira)</h3>\n\n<p>A restored wine press (lagar) in the charming town of Tavira, now producing wines that celebrate the eastern Algarve's distinct character. This is wine tourism combined with history — the building itself tells the story of traditional winemaking.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Those staying in the eastern Algarve who want to explore local wine without travelling west.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"quinta-dos-sentidos\">Quinta dos Sentidos</h3>\n\n<p>With a 4.8-star rating, this small quinta consistently delights visitors with personal attention and excellent wines. The name means \"Estate of the Senses,\" and that's exactly what they deliver — wine tasting as a full sensory experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wine enthusiasts seeking intimate, high-quality tastings away from the crowds.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"wine-tour-options-finding-your-perfect-experience\">Wine Tour Options: Finding Your Perfect Experience</h2>\n\n<p>You have three main options for Algarve wine tasting: self-drive visits, guided tours, or combination experiences. Here's how to choose:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"self-drive-winery-visits\">Self-Drive Winery Visits</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Flexibility to choose your pace, cheaper if you're a small group, can combine with other activities</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n<p>One person can't drink, need to book each winery separately, can be tricky to find rural estates</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Couples or groups with a designated driver, independent travellers, those with specific wineries in mind</p>\n\n<p>Most wineries welcome walk-in visitors, but booking ahead is always recommended, especially in summer. Contact wineries directly or check their websites for tasting options and prices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"guided-wine-tours\">Guided Wine Tours</h3>\n\n<p>This is our recommendation for most visitors. A guided tour means everyone can taste, transportation is handled, and a knowledgeable guide adds context you'd miss on your own.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"article-image\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1474722883778-792e7990302f?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=1200\" alt=\"Wine glasses lined up for tasting with bottles and vineyard view, Algarve wine experience\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Wine glasses lined up for tasting with bottles and vineyard view, Algarve wine experience</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p><strong>From Lagos:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/algarve-l66/from-lagos-small-group-4-hour-wine-tasting-tour-t400250/?partner_id=YTNRNDJ&utm_medium=online_publisher&cmp=blog\">Small Group 4-Hour Wine Tasting Tour</a> is perfect for visitors staying in the western Algarve.

An excellent time for wine touring.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Hot days make morning or late afternoon visits more comfortable. Book tours early in the day. Wineries are busier but the atmosphere is lively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Harvest Season (September-October):</strong> The most exciting time to visit if you're a serious wine enthusiast. You might see grapes being picked and processed, and the energy at wineries is electric. Book well in advance — this is popular with wine tourism visitors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Winter (November-March):</strong> Quieter and cooler, but most wineries remain open. Some reduce hours, so call ahead. The Algarve's mild winter means wine touring is pleasant year-round.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"booking-tips\">Booking Tips</h3>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Book tours 3-7 days in advance</strong> in summer, especially for small group experiences</li><li><strong>Morning visits</strong> are better for serious tasting — your palate is fresher</li><li><strong>Weekdays</strong> are quieter than weekends at popular estates</li><li><strong>Combine with lunch</strong> — many wineries have restaurants or can recommend nearby options</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"wine-tasting-tips-for-your-visit\">Wine Tasting Tips for Your Visit</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-to-wear\">What to Wear</h3>\n\n<p>Smart casual is appropriate everywhere. Comfortable shoes are essential if you're touring vineyards — the terrain can be uneven. Bring layers; wine cellars are cool even in summer.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tasting-etiquette\">Tasting Etiquette</h3>\n\n<p>Don't worry about being an expert. Winemakers appreciate genuine curiosity more than technical knowledge. That said:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Swirl, smell, then taste</strong> — it's not pretentious, it genuinely helps you experience the wine</li><li><strong>Use the spittoons</strong> if you're driving or want to pace yourself through multiple wines</li><li><strong>Ask questions</strong> — this is how you learn, and winemakers love sharing their knowledge</li><li><strong>Take notes</strong> on your phone if a wine impresses you — it's easy to forget names after several tastings</li></ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"portuguese-wine-culture\">Portuguese Wine Culture</h3>\n\n<p>Wine in Portugal isn't precious or intimidating. It's part of daily life, meant to be enjoyed with food and conversation. Approach tastings with this spirit and you'll connect with the experience on a deeper level.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"driving-considerations\">Driving Considerations</h3>\n\n<p>Portugal has strict drink-driving laws (0.5g/l limit, lower than the UK). If you're driving yourself:</p>\n<ul><li>Use spittoons freely</li><li>Share tastes rather than finishing every pour</li><li>Allow time between your last wine and driving</li><li>Better yet, book a tour and let someone else drive</li></ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-algarve-wine-known-for\">What is Algarve wine known for?</h3>\n\n<p>Algarve wines are known for full-bodied reds with ripe fruit flavours and low acidity, made possible by the region's exceptional sunshine. The indigenous Negra Mole grape is unique to the region and produces versatile wines from white to red. The region has four DOC designations and over 50 wineries, with a growing reputation for quality that's beginning to rival more famous Portuguese wine regions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-much-does-wine-tasting-cost-in-the-algarve\">How much does wine tasting cost in the Algarve?</h3>\n\n<p>Basic tastings start around €15-25 per person and typically include 3-5 wines. More comprehensive experiences with vineyard tours and food pairings range from €35-60. Full wine tour experiences with transportation and multiple wineries cost €55-80. Premium experiences like \"winemaker for a day\" can reach €150 or more.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-negra-mole-wine\">What is Negra Mole wine?</h3>\n\n<p>Negra Mole is an indigenous grape variety found only in the Algarve — the second-oldest grape variety in Portugal. Despite the name meaning \"soft black,\" it produces wines ranging from light whites to medium-bodied reds, depending on vinification. Once covering 75% of Algarve vineyards, it nearly disappeared but is now being revived by local winemakers. Ask for it specifically during tastings — it's the most authentic Algarvian wine experience.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"are-there-wine-tours-from-lagos\">Are there wine tours from Lagos?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes. Several operators offer half-day wine tours departing from Lagos. The <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/algarve-l66/from-lagos-small-group-4-hour-wine-tasting-tour-t400250/?partner_id=YTNRNDJ&utm_medium=online_publisher&cmp=blog\">Small Group 4-Hour Wine Tasting Tour from Lagos</a> is a popular option that visits multiple wineries in the central Algarve, with transportation included. Self-drivers can also reach excellent wineries like Monte da Casteleja within 20 minutes of Lagos.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-algarve-wineries\">When is the best time to visit Algarve wineries?</h3>\n\n<p>The best times are late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October). You'll enjoy pleasant weather, fewer crowds, and — in autumn — the excitement of harvest season. Summer works well if you book morning tours to avoid the heat. Winter is quietest but still possible thanks to the Algarve's mild climate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-you-visit-algarve-wineries-without-booking-a-tour\">Can you visit Algarve wineries without booking a tour?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, most wineries welcome independent visitors, though booking ahead is recommended, especially in summer. Contact wineries directly to arrange tastings. Self-driving is practical if you have a designated driver; otherwise, guided tours mean everyone can taste freely.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-many-wineries-are-in-the-algarve\">How many wineries are in the Algarve?</h3>\n\n<p>Over 50 wineries currently operate in the Algarve, with more opening as the region's reputation grows. They range from small family operations producing a few thousand bottles to larger estates with international distribution. Most are concentrated in the Lagoa/Silves area, with others spread across Lagos, Portimão, and Tavira.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-food-pairs-with-algarve-wine\">What food pairs with Algarve wine?</h3>\n\n<p>Algarve wines pair beautifully with regional cuisine: grilled fish and seafood with white wines, cataplana (the traditional copper-pot stew) with reds, and local cheeses and cured meats with either. Many wineries offer tasting platters featuring regional products. For a full experience, follow your wine tasting with lunch at a traditional restaurant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"is-the-algarve-a-good-wine-region\">Is the Algarve a good wine region?</h3>\n\n<p>The Algarve is increasingly recognized as one of Portugal's most exciting wine regions. While it lacks the fame of the Douro or Alentejo, the quality has improved dramatically over the past two decades. International wine critics are taking notice, awards are accumulating, and the intimate, uncrowded tasting experiences offer something the famous regions cannot.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-you-buy-algarve-wine-outside-portugal\">Can you buy Algarve wine outside Portugal?</h3>\n\n<p>Export remains limited — most Algarve wines are consumed locally or sold directly to visitors. This is part of what makes wine tasting here special: you're drinking wines that rarely leave the region. Some estates ship internationally; ask during your visit. Otherwise, buy bottles to bring home — they make excellent souvenirs that capture a taste of your trip.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"plan-your-algarve-wine-experience\">Plan Your Algarve Wine Experience</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"article-image\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516594915697-87eb3b1c14ea?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=1200\" alt=\"Wine barrels aging in a traditional Portuguese wine cellar\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Wine barrels aging in a traditional Portuguese wine cellar</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The Algarve offers something increasingly rare in wine tourism: authentic experiences without the crowds, pretension, or premium prices of more famous regions. Whether you spend an afternoon at a single quinta or dedicate a full day to exploring the Silves wine country, you'll discover a side of the Algarve that most visitors never see.</p>\n\n<p>Our recommendation? Book a <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/s?q=Algarve+vinho&searchSource=3&src=search_bar&dynamicFilter=tc-104&sort=popularity&partner_id=YTNRNDJ&utm_medium=online_publisher&cmp=blog\">guided wine tour</a> early in your trip. You'll learn what you like, get recommendations for other wineries to visit, and start your holiday with a deeper connection to this beautiful region.</p>\n\n<p>The beaches will still be there when you get back. But first, raise a glass of Negra Mole and toast to the Algarve — there's more here than meets the eye.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your local friend in the Algarve is just one email away.</strong></p>\n",
